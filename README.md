# Hi! It's me, Kim 🙋🏼‍♀️

</header>

### A little more about me
<p>Hi! I'm Kim, on GitHub known as Kimmymore. <br>
I'm a cloud infra specialist based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. <br>
I'm best known with Microsoft Azure, but also know my way around on Amazon AWS. <br>
When it comes to infrastructure as code I'm on team Terraform, though I am also familiar with ARM and Bicep. <br>
</p>

<p>I focus on cloud infrastructure with an application modernisation mindset. I prefer PaaS and containerised solutions over good ol' VM's. <br>
I've noticed that infra engineers and application developers ofter don't understand each other well, so I like to bridge that gap. Because I believe that cloud infrastructure and application code need to be well integrated with and adjusted to each other to get the best results I'm also interested in knowing more about application development. Not only when it comes to code languages, but also workflow principles and design. <br>
When cloud infrastructure and application code are working together we can lower the costs, limit the impact on the environment (by using less computing power) and give developers freedom to develop, while still keeping the environment secure. 
</p>

### I'm currently learning
I'm currently learning Python!

### Ask me about
Ask me about cloud infrastructure and how to use it in an optimal way, how to efficiently deploy to Azure and AWS, how to secure your cloud environment and how to design a cloud environment that meets your needs. 

### Fun fact
Though based in The Netherlands I call Brazil my second home (who knows someday first). I love to travel and explore the world, but Brazil caught my heart in a different way. I prefer to spend a couple of months a year there, especially during the cold Dutch winter ❄️ <br>
I also speak fluent Portuguese! 🇧🇷 <br>
Oh, and palm trees always make me happy! 🌴 <br>
